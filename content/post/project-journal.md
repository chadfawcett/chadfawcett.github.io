I've decided that I start a lot of projects, learn, create, and then *almost*
finish and usually end up with nothing really to show for it. I had an idea to
start posting about my projects on a more frequent interval and in a really
rough/non-polished format. My hope is that rather than getting 75% through a
project with nothing to show, I'll instead get 60% through a project with
several small updates/summaries of what I've accomplished. 

One side affect I'm hoping to get from this is that the visibility of it will encourage me to finish projects....but we'll see what happens.

I'm treating this website itself as my first project. I have several ideas for it, but I figured I should just throw something up to start. I chose to use Hugo as the static site generator because it seems fast, and I had frustrations with Jekyll (or rather Ruby) in the past.
