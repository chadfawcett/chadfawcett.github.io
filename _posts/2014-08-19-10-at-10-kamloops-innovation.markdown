The [office](http://kamloopsinnovation.ca) I work in holds a weekly '10 @ 10'. It is a short 10 minute presentation done by one of the tenants of the office spaces that is presented during a coffee/snack break. The presenters usually volunteer but are occasionally voluntold. The topics of discussion can be on anything of the speakers interest.

Last week I volunteered to present. Not knowing what I was going to present, I instantly went into panic mode. It took me a day or two to decide what I wanted to talk about. I decided to present the basics of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) as I knew it would force me to learn more about it which was useful as I have a couple projects that are going to be made with it.

I found a few very nice features of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Since it creates a static website, it is very light/fast to load. There are no database requests being made in order to construct the page you are about to view, all this is done before uploading. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) sites can also be hosted for **FREE** using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com). Using this technique is really nice as you could have a few people writing posts for a blog and all they have to do is create a pull request with the contents of their post in simple Markdown format.

I look forward to using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) in future projects as it is a very simple, yet powerful, tool to use. When paired with [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com), I don't know why you would want to use anything else when it comes to simple websites.
