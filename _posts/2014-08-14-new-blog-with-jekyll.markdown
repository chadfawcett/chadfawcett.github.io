So I finally set up a blog that I hope to keep up to date. I plan to post about several different topics including projects, frameworks, tools, services, solutions, etc.

This blog was created using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static website generating framework. It is very simple to use once you have created the template. You simple created pages and posts using markdown. [GitHub](https://github.com) will also host [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) sites for free!

There is a project that I am working on that would greatly benefit from good free hosting as well as having its source code public on [GitHub](https://github.com) so I was needing to learn all this anyways.
