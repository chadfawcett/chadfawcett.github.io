I have been working quite a bit lately so I decided to take a couple days off of work (one day from each job). My brother (Jake) was camping in [Wells Gray](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/wells_gry/) so my other brother (Nathan) and I decided to go there and catch up with him.

In order for us to have the most time available up there, we left after work on Saturday and did not arrive until 10:30 pm. We sat up watching the fire for a few hours and then went to bed knowing we had a full day ahead of us.

The next day consisted of several hikes, some sight seeing, lots of group selfies, some tree climbing, and a little bit of swimming. At the end of the day we made another fire and say around it for several more hours. As the sun went down, the stars came out for a beautiful view just before bed.

Even though the second morning I was surprised to find that a mouse had spent the night making a mess in my car, it was a very nice trip and well worth the time off work. I hope to make it up for another weekend once school starts up again.
