I am a software developer, and I like to travel! While I have been spending a lot of time doing web development, I do enjoy other types of development, including tinkering with electronics. In my spare time I enjoy getting fresh air by going on hikes and ... You know what?! I'm no good at this, so I will let the individual blog posts describe me and what I like to do. Have fun.
