Hi! My name is **Chad Fawcett**, I am currently pursuing a Bachelors Degree in Computing Science at Thompson Rivers University. I really enjoy technology and how quickly it improves. However, I do also like to leave my cave every once in awhile in order to go hiking, fishing, camping, etc. I really do like the outdoors, at least when the weather behaves.

I have worked for a couple different technology companies in British Columbia and Alberta. I plan to continue on this path by participating in different work experiences throughout my degree.
